**Purpose:**  This notebook processes audio transcripts from YouTube videos and uses OpenAI's language models to extract insights relevant to music production techniques, specifically volume, panning, reverb, delay, EQ, and compression.

**Key Libraries:**

* **youtube_transcript_api:** For retrieving video transcripts.
* **requests:** For making API calls to OpenAI.

**Workflow:**

1. **Obtain Transcript:** Transcripts are fetched from YouTube videos using the provided video IDs.
2. **Detailed Summary:** OpenAI (GPT-4) generates a detailed summary of production advice, including timestamps.
3. **Concise Summary:** The detailed summary is further distilled into 2-3 sentences focusing on game-relevant insights.
4. **Error Handling:** Exponential backoff is implemented to handle OpenAI API rate limits.
5. **Output:** Results are saved in a JSON file (`video_summaries.json`).

    "with feedback across 6 dimensions: volume, panning, reverb, delay, EQ, and "
    "compression. The game is divided into four modules, with each module giving the "
    "player more parameters to try and achieve a reference mix. The controls the player "
    "has access to in each module is as follows:\n"
    "Volume: Module 1 to 4: 10 possible loudness values, between -30dB and +6dB.\n"
    "Panning: Module 1: -1.0, 0.0, +1.0; Module 2: -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, +0.5, +1.0; "
    "Module 3: -1.0 to +1.0 in increments of 0.25; Module 4: -1.0 to +1.0 in increments of 0.1.\n"
    "Reverb: Module 1: None, Room Reverb; Module 2: None, Room Reverb, Outdoor Reverb; "
    "Module 3: None to Plate Reverb; Module 4: None to Hall Reverb.\n"
    "Delay: Module 1: No Delay, Half note delay; Module 2 to 4: No Delay to Sixteenth note delay.\n"
    "EQ: Each band can have any increment of 0.1 between 0.0 (-6dB) and 1.0 (+6dB); "
    "Module 1 to 4: High Pass to High Band.\n"
    "Compression: Module 1: Ratio, with Threshold fixed at -15dB; Module 2: Threshold, with Ratio fixed at 2:1; "
    "Module 3: Threshold, Gain, with Ratio fixed at 2:1; Module 4: Threshold, Gain, Attack, with Ratio fixed at 2:1."
